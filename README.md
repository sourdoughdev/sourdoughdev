👋🏻 I’m Thomas McGoey-Smith, a software developer (and avid sourdough baker) based in Victoria, British Columbia 🇨🇦.


**During the day**

I'm a software developer at [Shopify](https://shopify.com)! Writing a ton of Go for *****. If you're excited about commerce and making an impact, I'm always free to chat! Just [reach out](mailto:thomas@sourdough.dev)!

**Outside of Work**

Life! I'm focused on becoming a better [sourdough baker](https://instagram.com/sourdough.dev) this year, along with dabling on a few tiny [side projects](https://overridebot.com) to dabble with go.
